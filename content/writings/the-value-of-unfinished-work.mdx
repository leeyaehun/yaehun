Not everything needs to be completed to be valuable. Fragments, drafts, and abandoned projects contain seeds of future breakthroughs. Our culture overvalues completion and undervalues the generative power of the incomplete.

I keep an archive of unfinished work. Every abandoned project, every half-formed idea, every draft that did not quite work. I return to this archive regularly, and I am consistently surprised by what I find there.

Often, an idea that failed in one context succeeds in another. A technique that did not work for one project becomes essential for the next. The unfinished work is not wasted; it is composting.
