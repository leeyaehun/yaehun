Constraints do not limit creativity. They shape it. The most interesting work often emerges from the narrowest corridors. When we remove all boundaries, we paradoxically find ourselves paralyzed by infinite possibility.

Consider the sonnet. Fourteen lines, a strict rhyme scheme, iambic pentameter. Within these rigid walls, Shakespeare found room for the full range of human emotion. The constraint did not diminish the work; it gave it form.

In my own practice, I have found that setting arbitrary limits leads to unexpected breakthroughs. When I restrict myself to a single tool, a single color, or a single hour, I am forced to think differently about the problem at hand.

The key insight is that constraints force prioritization. When you cannot do everything, you must decide what matters most. This act of deciding is itself a creative act, perhaps the most important one.

I have begun to think of constraints not as obstacles but as collaborators. They push back against my impulses and force me to justify every decision. The work that survives this pressure is stronger for it.
